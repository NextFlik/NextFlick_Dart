## Inspiration
Not being able to decide movies to watch.
## What it does
Allows a user to swipe through over 122,000 movies and either save them or get rid of them.
## How we built it
Using Dart with Flutter as well as The Movie Database API.
## Challenges we ran into
Switching the entire codebase from React to Dart.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Querying APIs asynchronously, Pivoting with only 10 hours left, hosted on github pages
## What we learned
Firebase (earlier version), and React sucks (verified by John).
## What's next for NextFlik
Adding better functionality for singular users and support for groups of people trying to pick out a movie.
